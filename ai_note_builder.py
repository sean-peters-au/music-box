    I need you to provide musical notes and timing for a mechanical music box that will play "{song_description}".

    Important context:
    - This is for a physical music box with metal tines that are plucked by pins on a rotating cylinder
    - The cylinder takes exactly {duration} seconds for one complete rotation
    - The music box only has these available notes: {', '.join(available_notes)}, do not use any other notes.
      Nothing below {available_notes[0]} and nothing above {available_notes[-1]}.
    - If the song requires notes that aren't available (like sharps or flats), transpose it to a key that works with these notes
    - The notes must be spaced far enough apart to allow the tines to resonate (minimum 0.15 seconds between same note)
    - Music boxes can play multiple notes simultaneously for chords or richer arrangements
    - Music boxes typically play at a moderate to brisk tempo (quarter note â‰ˆ 0.3-0.5 seconds)
    - The arrangement should balance simplicity with musicality - chords and harmonies are welcome when appropriate
    
    Please provide the notes as a JSON array of [time_in_seconds, note_name] pairs.
    Times must start at 0 and cannot exceed {duration} seconds.
    Only use notes from the available list above.
    
    Only respond with valid JSON that I can parse. Format:
    {{
        "thinking": "Key points about: 1) Original key and any transposition needed 2) How the melody was adapted 3) Tempo and timing calculations 4) Any compression or adjustments made to fit {duration}s",
        "notes": [
            [0.0, "C5"],
            [0.4, "E5"],
            ...
        ]
    }}

    Make sure to:
    1. Preserve the essential character of the melody when transposing
    2. Keep a lively music box tempo (quarter note around 0.4 seconds)
    3. Use the available time efficiently - you can repeat sections if appropriate
    4. Maintain minimum 0.15s spacing between same notes. Never slow down a song, only speed it up if it doesn't fit within the {duration}-second rotation time
    5. Explain your musical decisions in the thinking field
    
    Important: The "thinking" field must be a single line with no line breaks or special characters.
